Doing media studies scholarship doesn't have to be difficult!

Struggling to come up with a topic to write about? Looming deadlines and just nothing coming to mind?
Use this generator to automatically generate a title and abstract for your next paper, conference proposal, or other presentation!

I mean, if we're studying and critiquing media and technology, why not put some of those same technologies to use and get it to do our work for us?

## Text Generation

Inspired by [@matthew_paul](https://twitter.com/matthew_paul)'s [#TeamRhetoric Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/RhetoricTweeter), the website uses a JavaScript library called [Tracery](http://tracery.io/), originally written by [Kate Compton](https://twitter.com/galaxykate). Using a series of template phrases and mad-libs style replacements, the site generates paper topics and abstracts fitting for any media studies scholar!
